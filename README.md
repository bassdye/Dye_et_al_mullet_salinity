RStudio project to statistically analyze (i.e. reproduce results from Dye et al. 202X) the compartmental usage of the thinlip mullet within an experimental water temperature preference chamber.

- mullet_temperature_preference.R - Statistically analyze the data for non random use of the preference chamber, conduct MANOVA to test for differences in compartment usage during the different observational phases and salinity treatments, rank the temperature compartments (i.e. most preferred to least preferred), and statistically test the preference rankings.

Abstract

`
Changes in environmental conditions due to climate change are linked to shifting species’ distribution ranges. Water temperature’s role in determining species ecology and biogeography has been well documented. However salinity’s ability to regulate species distribution has received less attention. Mullet (Mugilidae family) are considered climate change indicator species because their distribution is strongly linked to temperature. The species group is also very sensitive to salinity gradients. Therefore their expanding distribution may be limited by salinity gradients. To improve our understanding and ability to predict mullet’s plausible expansion into environments rapidly changing due to climate change, we used a water temperature preference chamber to examine the influence of salinity on the temperature preference of juvenile thinlip mullet (_Chelon ramada_). We found juvenile mullet preferred the temperature of 26.2°C, independent of salinity treatments (5 and 25 g/kg). Our findings provide novel, species-specific, and size-dependent insight which will improve estimations and model predictions of thinlip mullet distribution, particularly in response to climate change.
